## 🔧 Device Management

### Disconnect Single Device
Tap the "Disconnect" button on any device card to remove just that device.

### Disconnect All
Tap "Disconnect All" at the top to remove all devices at once.

### Already Connected Devices
Already-connected devices are hidden from the scan results list.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start HR Broadcast**: On your Polar watch, enable "HR sensor mode" or start broadcasting before scanning
2. **Stay Close**: Keep devices within Bluetooth range (~10 meters)
3. **Unique Names**: If possible, give each watch a unique name for easy identification
4. **Team Workouts**: Great for tracking your team's intensity during group training
5. **Coaching**: Connect your athletes' watches to monitor everyone in real-time

## 🆚 Single vs Multi-Device

| Use Case | Solo workouts | Team/group training |

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- Ensure watch is on and in HR broadcast mode
- Move closer to the device
- Try scanning again

### Connection Failed
- Make sure device isn't connected to another app
- Turn Bluetooth off/on on your phone

## 📈 What's Next?

Future improvements could include:
- Device nicknames
